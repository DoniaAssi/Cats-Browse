Project Idea:
The Cats Browse project is a simple and fast web application that displays cat images from the CATAAS API.
Users can add their favorite cats to a dedicated Favorites page.
Favorites are stored in localStorage, so they remain saved even after the page is reloaded.

How It Works
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
Fetches cat images from the CATAAS API using fetch().
Displays images in a grid layout with pagination for easy browsing.
Users can add or remove favorites, which are saved in localStorage.
The app is fully responsive, working on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
